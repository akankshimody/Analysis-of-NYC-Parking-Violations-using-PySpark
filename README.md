### Introduction
When you think of the Big Apple, you think street performers, a sea of people on foot and piles of cars on the streets. With a population of more than 9 million people, New York City is definitely a nightmare for those looking to find parking. Some say it is easier to recieve a NYC parking ticket than it is to find a legal spot for parking! 

In this project, we obtained data from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) to explore the various factors that might help prevent getting ticketed in NYC. The dataset consisted of ~10 million rows and had information related to location, time, vehicle type, violation type, etc. 

### Technology
The project was mainly implemented in PySpark and Python on the [Databricks](https://databricks.com/) platform and [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) was used for visualization.

### Insights and Recommendations

#### Business Applications
* Develop mobile applications that help people locate parking spots and alert drivers of locations where the chances of getting ticketed for a particular violation is higher. 
* Manage curb space better by converting more private parking spaces into new loading zones and reduce the amount of car storage in terms of parking on the street. This would give rise to a smarter way of managing rider share pickups, delivery systems and more space for bikes or scooters.
