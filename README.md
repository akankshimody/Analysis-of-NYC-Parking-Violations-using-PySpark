### Introduction
When you think of the Big Apple, you think street performers, a sea of people on foot and piles of cars on the streets. With a population of more than 9 million people, New York City is definitely a nightmare for those looking to find parking. Some say it is easier to recieve a NYC parking ticket than it is to find a legal spot for parking! 

In this project, we obtained data from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) to explore the various factors that might help prevent getting ticketed in NYC. The dataset consisted of ~10 million rows and had information related to location, time, vehicle type, violation type, etc. 

### Technology
The project was mainly implemented in PySpark and Python on the [Databricks](https://databricks.com/) platform and [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) was used for visualization.
